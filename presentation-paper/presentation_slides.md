### Slide 5: Problem Formulation

**Markov Decision Process (MDP) Definition:**

- Critical conditions → No_DDoS (safety fallback)
- Battery ≤20% or Temperature ≥80°C → Conservative approach
- TST usage only in optimal conditions

**Warm-Start Initialization:**
$$Q_0(s,a) = \begin{cases} 
3.0 & \text{if } a = \pi_{expert}(s) \\
1.0 & \text{if safe but not expert choice} \\
-100.0 & \text{if unsafe}
\end{cases}$$

### Slide 8: Training Algorithm

**Expert-Guided Q-Learning:**

```python
for episode in range(max_episodes):
    for step in range(max_steps):
        # ε-greedy action selection
        if random() < ε:
            action = random_action()
        else:
            action = argmax(Q[state])
        
        # Safety override
        if violates_safety(state, action):
            action = expert_policy[state]
        
        # Q-value update
        Q[state, action] += α[reward + γ * max(Q[next_state]) - Q[state, action]]
