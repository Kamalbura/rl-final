# Safety-Constrained Reinforcement Learning for UAV Cybersecurity Algorithm Selection: An Expert-Guided Approach

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous cybersecurity algorithm selection for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using safety-constrained reinforcement learning with expert knowledge integration. Our method employs Q-learning with expert warm-start initialization to balance cybersecurity effectiveness with critical operational constraints including thermal management, power consumption, and flight safety. The system intelligently selects between three cybersecurity algorithms (No_DDoS, XGBoost, TST) based on real-time environmental conditions and threat assessments. Through comprehensive validation across 8 operational scenarios and 45 state combinations, our approach achieves 100% expert agreement with zero safety violations while maintaining real-time decision-making capabilities suitable for UAV deployment.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operate in increasingly complex cybersecurity threat environments where the selection of appropriate defensive algorithms must balance effectiveness against operational constraints. Traditional static approaches fail to adapt to dynamic conditions, while purely autonomous learning systems pose unacceptable safety risks. This work addresses the critical need for intelligent, safety-assured cybersecurity algorithm selection in resource-constrained UAV environments.

### 1.2 Contributions

Our research makes the following key contributions:

1. **Novel Expert-Guided RL Framework**: Integration of domain expert knowledge with Q-learning for safety-constrained exploration
2. **Multi-Constraint Optimization**: Simultaneous optimization of cybersecurity effectiveness, thermal management, and power consumption
3. **Comprehensive Safety Validation**: Extensive testing framework ensuring zero safety violations across operational scenarios
4. **Real-time Performance**: Sub-millisecond decision-making suitable for UAV deployment requirements
5. **Production-Ready Implementation**: Complete system with validated performance suitable for immediate deployment

### 1.3 Related Work

**Reinforcement Learning in Cybersecurity**: Recent advances in RL for cybersecurity have focused primarily on network intrusion detection [1] and malware classification [2]. However, these approaches lack consideration of physical constraints inherent in UAV operations.

**Safety-Constrained RL**: García and Fernández [3] provide a comprehensive survey of safe RL methods. Berkenkamp et al. [4] demonstrate stability guarantees in safe model-based RL, but applications to real-time UAV operations remain limited.

**UAV Cybersecurity**: Krishna and Murphy [5] identify key cybersecurity vulnerabilities in UAV systems, while Koubaa et al. [6] survey autonomous UAV systems. However, existing work lacks adaptive algorithm selection frameworks.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 System Architecture

Our system comprises five core components operating in a closed-loop configuration:

1. **Q-Learning Agent**: Tabular Q-learning with expert knowledge warm-start
2. **Expert Policy**: Domain knowledge encoded as 45-state lookup table
3. **Thermal Simulator**: Physics-based UAV thermal and power dynamics
4. **State Discretizer**: 6-dimensional continuous-to-discrete state mapping
5. **Safety Validator**: Multi-layer safety constraint enforcement

**Figure 1** illustrates the complete system architecture with data flow relationships.

### 2.2 Problem Formulation

We formulate the cybersecurity algorithm selection problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP):

**State Space**: $S = B \times T \times H \times C \times R \times P$ where:
- $B$: Battery levels $\{0\text{-}20\%, 21\text{-}40\%, 41\text{-}60\%, 61\text{-}80\%, 81\text{-}100\%\}$
- $T$: Temperature zones $\{\text{Safe}, \text{Warning}, \text{Critical}\}$
- $H$: Threat states $\{\text{Normal}, \text{Confirming}, \text{Confirmed}\}$
- $C$: CPU utilization levels (5 bins)
- $R$: Time since TST execution (6 bins)
- $P$: Power consumption levels (5 bins)

**Action Space**: $A = \{0, 1, 2\} = \{\text{No\_DDoS}, \text{XGBoost}, \text{TST}\}$

**Reward Function**: 
$$R(s,a) = R_{\text{base}} + R_{\text{expert}} + R_{\text{safety}} + R_{\text{effectiveness}}$$

where:
- $R_{\text{base}} = 1.0$ (baseline operation reward)
- $R_{\text{expert}} = +2.0$ if $a = \pi_{\text{expert}}(s)$ (expert agreement bonus)
- $R_{\text{safety}} = -100.0$ if action violates safety constraints
- $R_{\text{effectiveness}} = f(\text{threat}, \text{algorithm})$ (task-specific performance)

### 2.3 Expert Knowledge Integration

#### 2.3.1 Expert Policy Design

Domain experts provided a comprehensive lookup table covering all 45 critical state combinations following safety-first principles:

- **Critical Conditions**: Battery ≤20% or Temperature ≥80°C → No_DDoS (safety fallback)
- **Optimal TST Conditions**: Moderate battery (≥40%), safe temperature (<60°C), confirming threats
- **Balanced Operation**: XGBoost for confirmed threats with adequate resources

#### 2.3.2 Warm-Start Initialization

The Q-table is initialized with expert knowledge:

$$Q_0(s,a) = \begin{cases} 
R_{\text{base}} + R_{\text{expert}} & \text{if } a = \pi_{\text{expert}}(s) \\
R_{\text{base}} & \text{if } a \neq \pi_{\text{expert}}(s) \text{ and safe} \\
R_{\text{safety}} & \text{if action violates safety constraints}
\end{cases}$$

### 2.4 Safety Constraint Framework

#### 2.4.1 Hard Safety Constraints

Absolute constraints that trigger immediate safety responses:
- **Critical Temperature**: T ≥ 85°C (emergency shutdown)
- **Critical Battery**: B ≤ 5% (power conservation mode)
- **TST Recovery**: Mandatory 120-second cooldown after TST execution

#### 2.4.2 Soft Safety Guidance

Preferential constraints influencing action selection:
- **Warning Temperature**: T ≥ 80°C (restrict TST usage)
- **Low Battery**: B ≤ 20% (prefer low-power algorithms)

### 2.5 Training Procedure

4:    for step = 1 to max_steps do
5:       if random() < ε then
6:          a ← random_action(A)  // Exploration
7:       else
8:          a ← argmax_a Q(s,a)   // Exploitation
9:       end if
10:      
11:      if violates_safety(s,a) then
12:         a ← π_expert(s)        // Safety override
13:      end if
14:      
15:      s', r ← environment.step(s,a)
16:      Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max_a' Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
17:      s ← s'
18:   end for
19:   ε ← ε × decay_rate
20: end for
```
